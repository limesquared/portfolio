    <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 21st, 1999. My mom is from Thailand while my dad is from Cambodia,
  although I can't speak either Thai/Laos or Khmer, I do mostly understand it. I currently attend High Point Central as a rising senior
  and plan on applying to UNC Greensboro, Appalachian State, and UNC Chapel Hill as my top three choices. My current choice of major
  is psychology. I have experience in graphic design programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as 3D Studio Max and GameMaker.
  Apparently, I have a knack for design.
    <h3>Likes</h3>
  In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels, writing fiction, and playing video games. Occasionally I draw, but not often.
  My favorite genre of fiction to read and write is fantasy, while my favorite authors include Ed Greenwood, R.A. Salvatore, and Stephen King.
  I also like sweet things and playing chess. A lot of my time is wasted on websites
  like <a href="http://tvtropes.org/" target="_blank">TVTropes</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>,
  and window-shopping on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.
    <h3>Dislikes</h3>
  I'm a very introverted person so I hate giving ad lib presentations, or really just presentations in front of crowds in general.
  I hate extremely crowded spaces and elevators, and hot humid weather. Spiders freak me out, I once found a two-inch long spider crawling up my leg, making me lose at least five years of my life.
  Also, people who breathe extremely loudly make me uncomfortable. Unless they can't help it.
